            <h1>SMART PATIENT HEALTH MOINTORING SYSTEM USING IOT</h1>
            <p>The "Smart Patient Health Monitoring System Using IoT" project aims to facilitate real-time monitoring of patients' health status through Internet of Things (IoT) technology. It utilizes sensors to continuously track vital signs such as body temperature, blood oxygen levels, and heart rate, alongside environmental factors like room temperature and humidity. At the core of the system lies the ESP32 microcontroller, which collects data from these sensors. This data is then sent to a cloud server for storage, analysis, and visualization purposes. The system is primarily focused on providing continuous monitoring rather than issuing alerts. The hardware setup entails connecting sensors to the ESP32 board, while software development is carried out using the Arduino IDE for programming the microcontroller.</p>
